Material: Al #The material name in the database
Circuit_Design:
   Width: 0.0004 #Trace width in m
   Radius: 0.0008 #Semicircle outer radius in m
   Thickness: 3.5e-8 #Trace thickness in m
   Width_Else: 0.0004 #The width of the trace for the rest of the circuit
   Length_Else: 0.005 #The length of the trace for the rest of the circuit

   
Experimental_Setup:
   Current_Limit: 20. #in A
   Voltage_Limit: 20. #in V
   B_Field: #This is for the calculation of magnetic Hall effect, which will not appear for superconducting case.
      External: #Set up the external field on the circuit by yourself. If this number is nonzero, then the self-generated field will be turned off. Default = 0
      Self_Generated_Coeff: #The coefficient in front of mu_0*I/(2\pi R). Default = 1. For two-layer design, set both to zero.
Output:
   Current_Sweep_Step: 0.1 #in A
